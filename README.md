# Overview

In this softwarre i show how to prefrom a clinet based server.To opreate the client based server you will need either the ip address or the local ip address for you computer on your networl. This has to be the same on the client and the sever for them to be able to connect to each other. This can be done by changing the code for the SERVER varible at the start of both the cleint and the server code file.

<br>
This program was written to show the model for the client based system. This software thaught me more abot threads and how  server can use threads to handle more than one clinet at a time. I was able to model this in python and get a better understanding of networking. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Network Communication

{Describe the architecture that you used (client/server or peer-to-peer)}

{Identify if you are using TCP or UDP and what port numbers are used.}

{Identify the format of messages being sent between the client and server or the messages sent between two peers.}
